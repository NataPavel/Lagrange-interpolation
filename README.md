INTERPOLATION OF DATA. INTERPOLATION LAGRANGE POLYNOMIAL. NUMERICAL DIFFERENTIATION.<br /><br />
Purpose: application of interpolation algorithms to construct a polynomial approximation
of a function; study of methods of numerical differentiation of a
function of one variable.<br /><br />
The task: approximate function f(x) polynomial Lagrange,
using global and piecewise interpolation on the given nodes. By the formulas
of numerical differentiation approximately
find the first and second derivatives of the function f(x) 
<br /><br />
f(x):<br/>
